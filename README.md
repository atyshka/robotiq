# Robotiq

This repo is forked from the [original] robotiq repo. I have made various modifications to the gripper for better integration with MoveIt, including adding a joint state publisher, switching the action server to joint states, and modifying some of the joints in SRDF to fix some MoveIt planning bugs.
